# test_settings.yaml
#
# Configuration for running data-driven tests in solver-core.
#
# mode: "all"      - Runs all .json files in the test_cases directory.
# mode: "filter"   - Runs only the tests whose names match one of the
#                  strings in `filter_patterns`.
#
# filter_patterns: A list of strings to match against the "name" field
#                  in the JSON test case files. This is only used
#                  when the mode is "filter".

# mode: "all"

# filter_patterns:
#   A list of strings to match against test case names. This is only
#   used when `mode` is set to "filter".
#   Example: ["Benchmark", "Constraint"]
#   filter_patterns: []
# --- Example for Filtering ---
# To run only specific tests, change the mode and add patterns like this:
#
mode: "all"
filter_patterns: []
# mode: "filter"
# filter_patterns: ["UI - Demo data test"]
